The order of precedence for the various CSS selectors
******************************************************

Different selectors naturally override others. Here is in order in which this takes place:

    1) The ID selector (always wins)
    2) The attribute selector
    3) The class selector
    4) The child selector
    5) The adjacent sibling selector
    6) The descendant selector
    7) The type selector



    The ID selector overrides all the selectors.

    The attribute selector overrides the class selector, the child selector, the adjacent sibling selector, the descendant selector and the type selector.
